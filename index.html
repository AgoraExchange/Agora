                  code that scales with you. No shortcuts, no recycled templates — just

                efficient tools. Today, that same mindset powers polished, reliable

                  Silicon Valley — defending systems by day, building for Agora by
                  choice. This is where they brainstorm, design from scratch, and write
                  code with the freedom and detail that senior full-stack engineers are
                  known for.
