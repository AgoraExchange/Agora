                  Every project at Agora is engineered with the same disciplined process:
                  research-backed planning, security-forward design, and clean, maintainable
                  code that scales with you. No shortcuts, no recycled templates — just
                  purposeful architecture built to last.

                Agora Exchange grew from the original Tornet Market — a small group of
                security-minded developers and investigators who loved creating clean,
                efficient tools. Today, that same mindset powers polished, reliable

                  choice. This is where they brainstorm, design from scratch, and write
